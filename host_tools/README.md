# Spartans Host Tools
The host tools are split into four different files that may be of interest.

* `enable_tool`: Send a packaged feature to the secure key fob device
* `package_tool`: Securely package a feature for a secure car device
* `unlock_tool`: Listens for unlock messages from the car while unlocking via button
* `pair_tool`: Implements pairing an unpaired key fob through a paired key fob

The host tools are written in Python 3.
